== About
Milo provides a commerce API that lets querying local store inventories for products. Using Milo API, one can easily get information about stores in a location, and 
whether they stock the products of interest. The API has endpoints that help find detailed information about local stores as well.

This is a Rails implementation of Milo API that also provides ample documentation on how these end points work. This is not meant to replace the Milo API documentation 
at http://www.milo.com/api-docs/endpoints.html, but provide an intuitive way to understand and use this API.
